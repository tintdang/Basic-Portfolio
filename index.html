                <p>Hello! My name is Tin Dang and I am working to become an aspiring web developer. I grew up utilizing computers
                    for a very long time and finally decided to take the jump into web development. I originally graduated
                    from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree of Social Work. After graduation, I was doing sales
                    at anime conventions for about a year and other odd jobs. But now it's time to take things up a notch
                    and jump into creating things that me or others imagine into reality! Thanks for visiting by my website!
                </p>
